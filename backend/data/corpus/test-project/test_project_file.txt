This is a test document for project management functionality.

This file will be used to test:
1. File upload to the main research corpus
2. Project assignment functionality  
3. File organization across projects
4. Search functionality within projects

The Ptaá¸¥ research assistant should be able to:
- Index this content for semantic search
- Allow assignment to specific research projects
- Maintain the file in the main corpus while organizing it by projects
- Provide contextual search results based on project scope

This demonstrates the hybrid corpus + project organization model.
